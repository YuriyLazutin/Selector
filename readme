A long time ago in the world of database developers there was a wonderful program such as PL/SQL Developer by Allround Automations.
It was fast, comfortable and just wonderful.
And the database developers loved it.
But as time went on, it acquired new, often unnecessary, opportunities.
The designers tried to improve the user interface, but they ended up with something creepy.
The program was getting fat, aging and becoming more awful and unwieldy.
The world was changed too.
The Windows operating system was reached the dead end, but Unix clones evolved.
The Pascal/Delphi programming language (on which PL/SQL Developer was created) has lost its former popularity.

Isn't it time to resurrect our favorite development tool?

The Selector program is the reincarnation of the favorite program of database developers.

The plans now include:
  1) to create the most similar user interface, but taking into account modern needs
  2) to throw out all unnecessary
  3) to expand the number of supported database servers
  4) to replace Pascal/Delphi with C++/Qt, thereby providing support for almost all modern operating systems

And let PL/SQL Developer be reborn like a phoenix and shine even brighter.
And his name will be Selector.
